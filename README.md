# This is "Spot"

## a image sharing platform engineered by Sean Semyck. It was created using HTML5 and CSS3. They are a cumination of everything I have learned in the first 3 TripleTen sprints.

### Improvements to be made:

- the "new post" modal needs functionality. When a new post form is submitted, it will be able to add a new card displaying the image, via a url link, with a caption.
- the like button needs functionality. When the user clicks the heart icon, it should change appearance to indicate that the user has "liked" the image/caption tied to it.
